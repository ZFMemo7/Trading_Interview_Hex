# Trading_Hex_Assessment
Part of Hex Trust's Coding Assignment. The exact questions are in their respective folders. Chose two questions out of three. Q2: Quantitative Development and Q3: Trading.

Specifically, Q2 is a technical write-up given some time and experiential constraints on my end, however, Q3 was done fully and with far greater depth, given my experience in products related to currencies and interest-rates.

Passed the assessment, two rounds of interview, and got the offer. Primarily worked on quantitative development.
