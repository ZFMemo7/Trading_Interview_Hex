    "Simply put, the funding rate is the periodical cost for traders for holding onto a market-perceived favorable positions. The rationale behind it is to more or less allow the futures price to track whatever pair it is tracking. For instance, if the market is bullish, more people will be long than short futures, so the funding rate is positive and longs will have to pay shorts. In turn, this cuts into the profits for the longs, disincentivizing them to hold onto positions for indefinitely long times and thereby allow the futures to converge to the underlying. The opposite occurs for the shorts. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, I have used a csv file from data pulled from Binance instead of directly using their API. This is just for exploratory purposes. Assumptions for calculating funding rate: (1) ETHUSDT Futures, (2) Interest rate per 8 hours at 0.01%, per Binance specificiations, (3) use ballpark figures for checking instead of full accuracy (perps funding rates are calculated on a 5 second basis, here I am using 1 minute data, so there are huge inaccuracies). \n",
    "\n",
    "On Binance Futures, the interest rate is fixed at 0.03% daily by default, (0.01% per funding interval since funding occurs every 8 hours)\n",
    "\n",
    "the Funding Rate is generally calculated by taking the time-weighted average across all 5,760 premium index data points for the 8-hour funding interval (60seconds/5 * 60min * 24hrs), but since I am using 1-minute data, I will only have 1440 data points for August 1st.\n"

    "The same way I would price a normal currency forward. So Forward (ETHUSDT) = Spot*[(1+rUSD) / (1+rETH)]^(t), where t here is in days since I'm using daily figures. The reason 1+rETH is at the bottom because the spot rate is quoted as USDT / ETH, so 1 ETH = $3045.30. Daily Binance interest rate is 0.03% as specified. Plugging in the numbers where Forward = 3045.30, Spot = 3005.77, rUSD = 0.03%, and t = 55 day, the calculated implied 55-day funding rate on ETH is ~0.344%, which is a daily return of 0.00624% and a yearly return of ~2.28%. Doing a quick math check, this is very much in line with current near-zero risk on ETH yields, for example, 2.61% for stETH. \n",

The 55-day return on stETH is ~0.393%, so I would be making 0.393-0.344 = 0.049% of no-risk arbitrage return, assuming the stETH returns do not move considerably. \n"
